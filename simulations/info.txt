Notes:

Exploratory simulations for assembly lines, flow shops, and job shops
based on qualitative interpretations of these factories description.

The encoding in the folder naming corresponds to the simulation id and is as follow:
A= Assembly Line, F= Flow shop, J= Job shop.
D = Deterministic, S= Stochastic, M= Medium (utilization factor of 0.54).

The folder REC_DATA holds csv files with feedback time stamps of job's processings as well as performance.
The processing data columns are organized as follows:
job id, work system id, beginning operation, end operation, work content.

Whereas the performance data:
simulation id, average throughput time, variance throughput times, average capacity utilization, average wip, average queue length
