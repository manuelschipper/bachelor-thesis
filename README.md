# Simulating manufacturing systems.

(in progress)

In my bachelor thesis we attempt to gain a more profound understanding on how does synchronization emerges and affects manufacturing systems.

It is in line with the ongoing research goal outlined in:

Chankov, S. M., Becker, T., & Windt, K. (2014). Towards Definition of Synchronization in Logistics Systems. Procedia CIRP, 17, 594-599.

We conduct an exploratory study for which I have programmed a computer simulation of queuing stations modeling manufacturing systems. It is primarly implemented using the SimPy module in Python.
